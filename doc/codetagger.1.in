.SH NAME
codetagger \- replaces the text between tags with text from tag file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcodetagger\fR [\fB-acdfLRt\fR] [\fB-in\fR \fIfile\fR] [\fB-l\fR \fIleftmarker\fR] [\fB-r\fR \fIrightmarker\fR] [\fB--test\fR | \fB-t\fR] [\fB--verbose\fR | \fB-v\fR] [\fIFILE\fR...]
.sp
\fBcodetagger\fR [\fB--help\fR | \fB-h\fR] [\fB--version\fR | \fB-V\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBCodetagger\fR is used to perform bulk text replacement in source files that
have been marked with tag pairs defined by the tag definition file. A
tag is as a alpha-numeric string that is enclosed by the \fIleftmarker\fR
string and the \fIrightmarker\fR string.  The alpha-numeric string conists of
a concatenation of the pair name followed by the tag state.  The pair name is
a user defined string which is unique to the tag pair. The tag state must be
either the string \fIstart\fR or the string \fIend\fR.  A tag pair must have
one \fIstart\fR tag and a matching \fIend\fR tag and the \fIstart\fR tag must
precede the \fIend\fR tag in both the definition file and the source files. All
tags are case insensitive.

\fBCodetagger\fR processes a file one line at a time.  If characters exist
between the start tag and beginning of the line, these characters will be
inserted at the beginning of every line replaced by the tag pair.  This allows
\fBcodetagger\fR to honor the comment characters and text layout of mulitple
file format.

Tag pairs to be replaced in source files are defined in the tag definition
file.  This file may contain multiple tag pair definitions.  A tag pair is
defined by placing a start tag on the beginning of a line.  The start tag
is followed by the tag body (the text to be inserted into the source files).
The tag body may contain multiple lines of text.  The tag pair definition is
ended by placing the end tag on the beginning of a line following the tag body.
If an end tag is missing, \fBcodetagger\fR will exit with an error. Nested tag
pairs will be ignored by \fBcodetagger\fR.
