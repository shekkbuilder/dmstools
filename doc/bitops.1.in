.SH NAME
bitops \- displays the result of two values after performing bitwise operations
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbitops\fR [\fB-BDOX\fR] \fInumber1 number2\fR
.sp
\fBbitops\fR [\fB--help\fR | \fB-h\fR] [\fB--version\fR | \fB-V\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBbitops\fR utility is a filter which displays the result of two values 
after using bitwise operations.  The operations performed are Arithmetic left
shift, Arithmetic right shift, AND, OR, Inclusive OR, and negation. Input
strings which are prefixed with \fI0x\fR are assumed to be hexidecimal
numerals.  Input strings which are prefixed with a single `\fI0\fR' character
are assumed to be octal numerals.  Input strings which are prefixed with
`\fI00\fR' are assumed to be binary numerals.  All other strings are assumed
to be in decimal numerals.
