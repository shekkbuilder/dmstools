.SH NAME
bindump \- displays the contents of a file in binary notation
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbindump\fR [\fB-drx\fR] [\fB-l\fR \fIn\fR] [\fB-o\fR \fIn\fR] [\fB--verbose\fR | \fB-v\fR] \fIFILE1\fR [\fIFILE2\fR] 
.sp
\fBbindump\fR [\fB--help\fR | \fB-h\fR] [\fB--version\fR | \fB-V\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBbindump\fR utility is a filter which displays the specified file, or the
standard input if no files are specified, using binary representation of the
data.  If two files are specified, only the 64 bit chunks which are different
between the two files are displayed.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Display only the bytes which do not match when comparing two files.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Displays usage information and exits.
.TP
\fB-l\fR \fIn\fR
Only process \fIn\fR bytes of data.
.TP
\fB-o\fR \fIn\fR
Move to the \fIn\fR byte of file before reading data.
.TP
\fB-r\fR
Display bits in little endian bit order (default is big endian bit order)
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
displays version number and exits.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR
Enable verbose output.
.TP
